Q2. Traversing a directory structure
    Create a subdirectory lab5. Use the ls command to recursively list the contents of
    your current directory and parent directory (including all the subdirectories). 

Answer:
ls -R or ls --recursive

Q3. Show the i-node number
    i) Show the i-node numbers for files in your directory.
    ii) Compare your results for this question with those of your classmates and answer the following question:
        Did you get the same i-node numbers as your classmates, and why?
    iii) Show your directory lab5’s metadata using the stat command. Explain the difference between this output and the output you obtained in 3.i.

Answer:
    i) ls -i or ls --inode
        In parent directory:
            5114617 as1  5262337 as3  5243435 as5  5243034 as7  5243858 as9   5262305 lab2  5243066 lab4  5252485 README.md
            5258591 as2  5264838 as4  5243377 as6  5243159 as8  5256960 lab1  5242994 lab3  5243508 lab5
        In lab5 directory:
            5243362 nathaniel_caron_lab5.txt

    ii) No, the i-node numbers were different. I-node numbers are unique within file systems and they are combined with file system number.

    iii)   File: lab5
            Size: 4096      	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory
            Device: 803h/2051d	Inode: 5243508     Links: 2
            Access: (0775/drwxrwxr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/nathanielcaron)   Gid: ( 1000/nathanielcaron)

            There is alot more information listed here compared to 3.i. The i-node number is also shown along with the rest of the file's metadata.
            (Name, Size, Blocks, Device, Access time, Last modifed time, Creation, etc.)

Q4. Copy a file
    i) Create a copy of some file in your directory. Show the i-node numbers for the original and copied files. Compare and comment.
