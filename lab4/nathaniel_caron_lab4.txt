Q1. 
i.  What programs did you start?
ii. What do you observe from the output of vmstat?

Answer:
i.  Started calculator, calendar, files, and terminal
ii. Free memory decreased, amount of memory used for buffers and cache increased
    The number of processes waiting for run time increased and went back down to zero once all programs were launched
    The number of interrupts and context switches increased significantly then went back down

Q2. 
i.  What process has the greatest number of page faults? 
ii. What is the difference between a major page fault and a minor page fault?

Answer:
i.  /usr/bin/gnome-shell
ii. Major Page Fault: Must first copy the page to the disk before replacing it with a new page since the page was written to (dirty)
    Minor Page Fault: Can immediately discard and replace the page in the frame
    A major page fault takes significantly more time and hurts performance more than minor page faults

Q3. 
i.  Can you think of a way to make the system have more major page faults? 
ii. What command(s) can you do to make this happen?

Answer:
i.  If a file is loaded into memory and we write to it, then it will have to be stored on the disk if the memory is to be replaced, causing a major page fault
ii. We can easily write to a file with the command:
    echo "cs3413 lab4" > file.txt
    If we load several files into memory, write to them, and then leave to use other programs, then they will have to be swapped to the disk and will cause major page faults
